EasyCV is my current side project, the goal is to build a platform that can help you with all your job application documents, primarily focusing on CV and Cover Letter generation. I want to expand the offerings to include interview practice and job application tracking.

I am using this as an opportunity to experiment with new features in the Vercel AI SDK and to create B2C product genuinely worth paying for.

More details to come soon.

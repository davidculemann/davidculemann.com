JobSprout is a modern CV and cover letter builder that combines professional typesetting with context-aware AI assistance. After reviewing over 1,000 CVs as a senior engineer, I noticed most looked unprofessional and generic. I built JobSprout to solve this.

## Technical Approach

### Professional Typesetting
JobSprout uses [Typst](https://typst.app/) for document generation – a modern alternative to LaTeX that produces publication-quality typography without the learning curve. This ensures consistent spacing, proper kerning, and professional layouts that parse correctly in ATS systems.

### Context-Aware AI
Unlike other builders that only offer full-section rewrites, JobSprout provides granular control:
- Select any text from a single word to entire sections
- Direct specific improvements: length, tone, technical level
- AI Assistant with full document context for conversational editing
- No need to re-explain your background for each edit

## Key Features

- **Real-time preview** with instant Typst compilation
- **Drag-and-drop sections** for different job applications
- **Multiple document versions** with shared data
- **Import existing CVs** and improve incrementally
- **Professional templates** focused on readability over decoration
- **Cover letter generation** with matched styling
- **Unlimited PDF exports** without restrictions

## Current Status

Launched December 2025 with core CV and cover letter functionality. The roadmap includes CV scoring, application tracking, and interview preparation based on user feedback.

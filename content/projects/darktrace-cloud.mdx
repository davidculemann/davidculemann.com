Darktrace /CLOUD is a comprehensive cybersecurity platform designed to help organizations secure and manage their cloud environments. The core principle of operation involves enumerating all cloud assets misconfigurations such as S3 buckets with overly permissive access. It offers tools to customize security postures, guide the user through remediation steps, and streamline workflows with features like one-click ticket creation and autononous response.

My current role is as leader UI developer for Darktrace /CLOUD, which I have overseen from the very start, through first release, and currently working on a wide range of cloud innovations.
